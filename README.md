# Landscape or Cityscape

The goal of this project is to train a convolutional neural net to classify images as either a picture of a landscape or a picture of a city. To gather data for this project I scraped about 6000 images from the subreddits [r/EarthPorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/) and [r/CityPorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/CityPorn/).

These subreddits are well moderated collections of landscape and city pictures respectively. Because these subreddits are well moderated I could essentially use them as labeled data for a classifier.
